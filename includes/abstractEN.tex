This thesis outlines IPC mechanisms available in the Linux operating system and provides details of the associated internal structures, as well as the operation and use of these mechanisms. Structure and behaviour of the security system Medusa and the LSM framework are described together with the role of the authorisation server and its variants in the system. The work of this thesis includes implementation of further components of the security system Medusa, whose role is to catch system calls of the IPC mechanisms, manage their structures, and decide whether to allow or reject these system calls. Furthermore, the thesis provides a detailed overview of the structures and functions used, together with their meaning, and describes the use of these newly-developed entities.
